# Minerva Technical Assessment

Thank you for your interest in Minerva! In order to make sure that everyone we hire has a core set of competencies, we've created a coding challenge for you. Your task is to create a clone of http://itsthisforthat.com.

1. Requirements
    1. Your site must...
        1. Look visually distinct from the original while retaining all of its functionality.
        2. Use the exact same set of options (this + that pairings) as the original site.
        3. Not use jQuery.
        4. Change the current this/that pairing without reloading the page when the user clicks `Refresh`.
    2. Bonus points for...
        1. Implementing your clone using React.
        2. Setting up an API to fetch word pairings and including it with your submission. This should mirror the format of http://itsthisforthat.com/api.php?json
        3. **NOTE** None of these are required. Do not feel obligated to do these.
    3. Side notes
        1. You are allowed to use any 3rd party libraries other than jQuery.
2. Submission:
    1. Submit your application as a .zip file.
    2. Include a README.md with...
        1. Instructions on how to set up and run your project in a `*nix` environment.
        2. 1 paragraph or a short bulleted list describing your process (ie. how you built the clone).
    3. Please also include this file with your submision.

Note that many of these requirements are purposefully open ended to allow for creative implementations.
